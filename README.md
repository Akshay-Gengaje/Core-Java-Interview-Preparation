### **Important Topics for Interviews**
#### **High-Priority Topics:**
1. **OOP Principles**: Deep understanding of inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism.
2. **Collections Framework**:
   - Internal workings of `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, and `HashSet`.
   - Difference between `HashMap` and `TreeMap`.
   - Fail-fast vs fail-safe iterators.
3. **Exception Handling**: Propagation, checked vs unchecked exceptions.
4. **Multithreading and Concurrency**:
   - Synchronization, `volatile`, `ExecutorService`.
   - Deadlock scenarios and how to avoid them.
5. **Java 8 Features**:
   - Lambda expressions, Streams API, Optional class.
   - Functional interfaces (`Predicate`, `Consumer`, `Supplier`).
6. **Design Patterns**:
   - Singleton, Factory, Strategy, Observer.
7. **String Handling**:
   - Immutability, `StringBuffer` vs `StringBuilder`, memory management.
8. **File I/O**: Serialization, NIO basics.
9. **JDBC**: Prepared statements, connection pooling.

#### **Medium-Priority Topics:**
1. Java Memory Management and Garbage Collection.
2. Custom annotations and meta-annotations.
3. Enum usage with advanced use cases.

Focusing on these topics while preparing for interviews will maximize your success as a Java developer with 2 years of experience!
